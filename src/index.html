                    Green walls, also known as living walls, vertical gardens or in some cases, green facades, are well designed collections of plants that have been intricately planned and arranged to create organic pieces of art. These beautiful features are able to thrive in both indoor and outdoor conditions and can serve a variety of spaces, big or small. Not only do these features visually enhance a space, they also bring many benefits for building occupants and visitors. The ideal environments for a green wall display are any meeting rooms, hallways, reception or breakout areas lacking in colour and texture.

                    As a full-service interior landscape provider, we can work with your team from the design and pre-construction phase through completion. Our designs are informed by aesthetics, budgets, maintenance considerations and the lifecycle of the plant or product.

                    The best plants for workspaces are generally tolerant to lower light levels and maintain form over time. Greenery and natural color enhance any office environment. Workspace plants are inexpensive and easy to maintain with the help of a professional plant service. Our office plant rentals can help take the burdens of plant care and maintenance off your shoulders.

                    Using a range of stunning potted plants including maples, palms, bays and bamboo, we can design your office space and workplace to look lush, alive & more organic â€” with the knowledge that they won't wither and die. These plants come in a range of sizes to suit all spaces and of course they are fire-retardant. The main benefit of artificial plants is the peace-of-mind knowing that the plants will not lose their leaves due to plant diseases. Your artificial folige displays will live on forever!
